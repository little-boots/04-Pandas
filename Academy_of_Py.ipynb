    "## Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Surprisingly, for the schools analyzed, spending per student was inversely related to student performance for both reading and mathematics.  This effect was more pronounced for mathematics (93.7% passing rate in the lowest-funded schools vs. 66.6% in the highest-funded) than for reading (96.7% vs. 80.8%).\n",
    "    * School size was also inversely related to student performance.  The smallest five schools had 90.4% of students passing both math and reading.  By contrast, only 53.6% were passing both in the largest five schools.\n",
    "    * There was a sharp division between district and charter schools.  Each of the top five schools by overall passing rate was a charter school, whereas each of the bottom five schools was a district school.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "In light of the counterintuitive relationship between student spending and performance and of the strong effect of school type, it is likely some confounding is taking place.  It may be that charter schools, though working with smaller budgets, acheive favorable performance due to smaller class size and the ability to be selective in their admissions.  It would be interesting to see if student spending had the same relationship after grouping schools by type.\n"
